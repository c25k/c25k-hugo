## [Podrunner Intervals: First Day to 5K](http://www.djsteveboy.com/intervals.html)

Mixed by DJ BeatSmith, this first 27-minute set is said to be a great introduction to the world of interval training to start you on your path to a nonstop 5K run! Graham Cairns (who's into the DJ Steveboy stuff) says there are no VERBAL cues to change from walking to running - but a very noticeable musical cue ... and the bpm changing from an obvious jogging speed to an obvious walking one.

## [Phedippidations: The C25K Episode](http://steverunner.blogspot.com/PodCasts/Fdip86.mp3)

Listen to Steve Runner, the high priest of running Podcasters talk about the Couch to 5k program. A great background in C25K.
