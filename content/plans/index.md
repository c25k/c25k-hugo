## [Running for Beginners](http://www.runningforbeginners.com/)

The first place to visit for anyone looking to start running. Provides a heap of good advice for those wanting to run 5k plus links to Couch to 5k resources.

## [The C25K program at Cool Running](http://www.coolrunning.com/)

These are the guys who started all this and is where to get a copy of the program. In addition to the free, printable version of the plan, you can keep track of your progress online using the ActiveTrainer training log. Note there is a cost for the training log.

## [Graham Cairns' Metric Version](http://c25k.io/plans/grahamcairns)

Graham's a C25K graduate from Brisbane Australia, and has very kindly converted the yards and miles to metres and kilometres for us.

## [C25K Treadmill Version](http://c25k.io/plans/c25kthreadmill)

Ian has converted the C25K program to make it super simple to follow if you are doing the workouts on a treadmill.

## [Pooch to 5k](http://www.poochto5k.com/)

If you have a dog, why not let him or her also enjoy the benefits of fitness while you are going from Couch to 5k? Developed by Audrey an Australian vet, Pooch to 5k will have you and your dog runnning 5km in just 12 weeks. I love running with my Boxer Gator...he is like having an instant running partner who is always ready to run when I am.
